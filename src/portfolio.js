                  The aim of the project is to calculate the risk score of any
                  institution based on some variables like internal fraud,
                  external fraud, business disruptions, system failures, and so

                </p>
                <p>
                  My role in this project was as a Full-stack developer working
                  with the tech stack vanilla Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, React on
                  the frontend, NodeJS on the backend, SQL as database, JIRA for
                  project management, and Redux as a state management tool.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My responsibility was to create an interface that provides the
                  admin user to select appropriate operational risks from the
                  dropdowns which in turn would provide a dynamic risk score
                  that would be helpful for the administration to make critical
                  decisions based on the scores generated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The project is already deployed to multiple private and
                  government banks. With the help of this app, the admin user is
                  now able to generate quarterly, monthly, or yearly reports of
                  the operational risk at their banks and branches make critical
                  decision accordingly.

                    This project was a company based with the aim of providing a
                    platform where the user could trim a section of a media and
                    provide the information of the trimmed media accordingly

                    Led a team of 3 engineers in building a Video tagging
                    system. Here, I created multiple reports of the user
                    interacting with the video and the details of the video like
                    the channel it's related to, maximum aired time weekly,
                    biweekly, and monthly. I also developed Plugins for ad
                    cutting, selecting timestamps, and reporting ad quality.
